# Voteana

### The Problem
- Our current voting system is a very physical process. We have to hurl voting machines to various places, count and recount at every stage and every movement, and manually add up the figures. It's painfully slow in the digitised world we live in today.
- Voters are often uninformed about their candidates. When they go to the ballot, all they have is the name of the candidate, photo and party symbol. Nothing else is known about their promises kept, education or criminal record.
- Voters have to be present in their constituency in order to vote, which is not always possible for them.

### Pushing voting to the digital age with Azure Blockchain
Voting has never been able to benefit from modern technology and the internet because it is fundamentally insecure and vulnerable to hacking, and in an election, no one can be trusted to ensure the integrity of the program or the vote tallying.

The introduction of blockchain changes this equation. Decentralised blockchain technologies ensure integrity of the vote tally as well as the program itself, due to its immutable nature.

Thus a decentralised app implemented on a blockchain will overcome present hurdles and enable us to reap the benefits of a modern web app, built on the Azure Blockchain.

### What we will be implementing
- Our program will be an ethereum-based dapp that will run on Azure Blockchain
- We will have a secure registration process for voters
- Voting is done on the blockchain. After the end of the voting period results are instantly declared.
- The UX will be designed to maximise voter satisfaction. The interface will reveal the assets, liabilities, criminal records, manifesto, educational qualifications and promises kept from the previous term, all scraped from reliable sources.
  - The promises kept will also be on a blockchain so as to avoid tampering from external malicious actors.
- The voter will be able to vote from any part of the country, they need not vote from their constituency itself.
- Support for [Instant-runoff voting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instant-runoff_voting) will be included, so the same application can be used for Presidential elections.

### Outcome
There will be huge time and cost savings, as tallying is done over a blockchain network.  
Voting will be more efficient as there won't be queues to ballots, and an array of workstations can be arranged for large-scale parallel voting. Voters will also be equipped and informed with knowledge about their candidates before they cast their vote. All of this, combined with the ability to vote from outside the constituency will also greatly increase turnout.
